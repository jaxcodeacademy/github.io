OOP: https://developer.hyvor.com/tutorials/php/oop-intro

OOP is harder to understand compared to other programming techniques. But, if you understand the following 4 terms you are almost done!

Class
Object
Properties
Methods (or Functions)

CLASS: The first term we find in OOP is class. A class is a blueprint. It is a piece of code describing how to manage a topic or task in the way we want.

OBJECT: An Object is an instance of a class. It is like a house built from the blueprint. You can build more than one object from a class like creating multiple houses from a blueprint.

PROPERTIES: Properties are variables of an object. They are the values associated with the object. They describe the appearance of the Object.

METHODS: Methods are actions that are performed on Objects. Changing the color of my house is a method performed on my house object.

PHP DECLARING A CLASS
The class keyword followed by the class name is used to declare a class.

<?php
class House {
	// code
}

PROPERTIES
Properties are variables

<?php
class House {
	public $primaryColor = 'black';
	public $secondaryColors = [
		'bathroom' => 'white',
		'bedroom' => 'light pink',
		'kitchen' => 'light blue'
	];
	public $hasPool = false;
	public $extra;
}

OBJECTS
We can create multiple objects from a class. These objects are called instances of the class. This process is called instantiation.

After the class declaration, you can create instances from it.


$myHouse = new House();
$friendHouse = new House();

Now each object is created having the default values of the class. You can check it by echoing the color of each object.


echo $myHouse -> primaryColor;
echo $friendHouse -> primaryColor;

Both would echo out the default value black.

Tip: When accessing properties and methods of an object through the object operator, the dollar sign $ is not used with the property or method name.

You can also change the default property values of the class to make each house unique.


$myHouse -> primaryColor = 'red';
$friendHouse -> primaryColor = 'yellow';

Now, the color of my house is red and the color of my friend's house is yellow.

METHODS 
Methods are used to perform actions.
In Object Oriented Programming in PHP, methods are functions inside classes. Their declaration and behavior are almost similar to normal functions, except their special uses inside the class.

Let's declare a method inside a class named Example class to echo out a simple string that we give.


<?php
class Example {
	public function echo($string) {
		echo $string;
	}
}

HOW TO CALL A METHOD
$example = new Example();
$example -> echo('Hello World');

CHANGING A PROPERTY USING METHODS 
<?php
class House {
	public $primaryColor = 'black';
	public function changeColor($color) {
		$this -> primaryColor = $color;
	}	
}

// creates an object from the class
$myHouse = new House();

# black (default value)
echo $myHouse -> primaryColor;

// change the color of the house
$myHouse -> changeColor('white');
	
# white
echo $myHouse -> primaryColor;

July 1 email, 14:26 from Shannon
Once the event passes 8 hours per day there is a discount.  For this particular event, I would recommend looking into the University Center as they do block rates that may be cheaper for the event you are looking to host. Rates are found here: https://www.unf.edu/universitycenter/Rooms_and_Rates.aspx.  If you want to stay at the Student Union I can speak with my Director about the pricing.

1. Research the federal EQUIP program
In 2016, the U.S. Department of Education announced the launch of the Educational Quality through Innovation Partnerships (EQUIP) program. EQUIP is a pilot program that allows low-income students to qualify for federal financial aid to pay for non-traditional education programs like coding boot camps.

Students who qualify for EQUIP can access all forms of federal aid: including student loans and grants. As a low-income student, you could receive a Pell Grant for coding boot camp.

INFORMATICS BOOTCAMPS

FOR ME: Apply thru ERAS:
https://www.cdc.gov/phifp/application.html
Application for the PHIFP Class of 2019 opens August 6, 2018.

Health informatics is information engineering applied to the field of health care, essentially the management and use of patient healthcare information.

Course will teach how to turn your ideas into functioning prototypes using HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQUERY, Bootstrap, PHP, and MySQL. Each student will be able to build an EMR application that is HIPAA compliant. In addition to class assignments students will help design and build real-world applications for healthcare.

Health Informatics:
Clinical Informatics
Human-Computer Interaction
Pharmacy Informatics
Imaging Informatics

EHR; CCD
Patient Portals; PHR
Telemedicine
Calculators


In 2016, research firm MarketsandMarkets projected that the health care IT solutions market would be valued at almost $229 billion by 2020, with a compound annual growth rate of more than 13 percent for the period of 2015 to 2020. For those who have the combination of health care knowledge and IT skills, there are a multitude of opportunities—yet demand for workers outstrips supply. As reported in findings of the 2017 HIMSS Leadership and Workforce Survey, “The majority of health IT employers (61 percent of vendors/consultants and 43 percent of providers) have positions they are looking to fill.”

At that point, I felt ready to run my first Epicodus class. I spent a couple months getting the curriculum ready and promoting the class: I announced at local meetups, emailed local tech mailing lists, posted on online forums, and listed our classes on several websites for coding schools.

Many competitive coding bootcamps require a certain level of coding knowledge or background in order to be accepted into their programs- whether they’re looking for past experience on your resume or require that you pass a coding challenge. For a beginner, it can be tough to get the experience that a selective bootcamp looks for in the application process. There are many ways to learn basic coding (including teaching yourself) but if you want to make sure you’re covering the right material and quickly, then a bootcamp prep program may be for you.

Method: plug and chug. anything rote and extremely repetitive which doesn't require any thinking. (particularly involving math problems). It refers to inserting one variable "x" (the plug) into an equation and get a result "y" (the chug).

The structure of our project should look like this:
index.html
	js
	images

Just like literacy opens up the whole world of books, coding literacy opens up a whole world of being able to create websites, apps, games, and even little robots.

================
<br><br>
									The average starting salary of a web developer who graduates from a coding bootcamp is $70,000 with at least 80% obtaining a job within six months. The average cost of a coding bootcamp is $11,000 (financing available) combined with our prep course, which is $2,500, so you can expect to pay around $15,000 and be ready to job hunt in 4 to 6 months. The immediate return on investment is obvious but is even more substantial if you factor in the savings of not attending a college program. While college students are spending $10,000 to $60,000 per year in tuition, and years in school, you will be working and earning money the whole time.<br><br>
									There are typically over 5,000 active job postings for web developers on Indeed.com at any time, with an estimated average annual salary of over $91K in the United States. The average annual salary for front end web developers is even higher, at $102K. Practically every organization in existence is finding and interacting with people via the web, making the position of web developer one of the most sought after.
